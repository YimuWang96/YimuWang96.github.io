## 1. Abstract

<p style="text-align: justify"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, we tackle a valuable yet very challenging visual recognition task, where the instances are within a sub- ordinate category, and the target domain undergoes a shift with the source domain. This task, termed as cross-domain fine-grained recognition, relates closely to many real-life sce- narios, e.g., recognizing retail products in storage racks by models trained with images collected in controlled environ- ments. To deal with this problem, we design a new algorithm and propose a corresponding fine-grained domain adapta- tion dataset. Firstly, we propose a novel end-to-end CNN architecture that integrates two specialized modules: an ad- versarial module for domain alignment and a self-attention module for fine-grained recognition. The adversarial module is used to handle domain shift by gradually aligning the dif- ferent domains with domain-level and class-level alignments, and strive to help the classifier learn with domain-invariant features generated by nets. The self-attention module is de- signed to capture discriminative image regions which are crucial for fine-grained visual recognition. Secondly, we col- lect a large-scale fine-grained domain adaptation dataset of retail products, which contains 52,011 images of 263 classes from 3 domains. Thirdly, we validate the effectiveness of our method on three datasets, showing that the proposed method can yield significant improvements over baseline methods on fine-grained datasets. Besides, we also evaluate the effectiveness of the self-attention module by performing visualization, which can capture the discriminative image regions in both source and target domains.

## 3. Our DA-Retail dataset 

<div align="left">

DA-Retail consists of 52,011 images of 263 fine-grained classes from 3 domains. Abundant images from multiple sources make our dataset more challenging. The collected fine-grained products are from the retail scenario, e.g., istant noodles, fruit juice, mineral water, yogurt, and milk.
